	<h1>Beetroot <em>(Beta vulgaris)</em></h1>
		<p>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.
		55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.
		The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a
		cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and
		shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p>
<blockquote>Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, “Battlestar Galactica.”</blockquote>
<cite>— Jim Halpert</cite>
<blockquote>I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will
clean them out of their beets.</blockquote>
<cite>— Chris Pratt</cite>
